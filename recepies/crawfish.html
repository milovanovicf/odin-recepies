    <h1>Instant Pot® Live Crawfish Boil for Four</h1>

    <h2>Descritpion</h2>
    <p>
      Every spring I do a crawfish boil and every year I think there has got to
      be an easier way. It takes 30 minutes to get the stockpot full of water to
      come to a boil and then the crawfish require 30 minutes of soaking, which
      results in overcooked potatoes and corn. This year I was determined to
      simplify the process and set out looking for an Instant Pot® method
      online. There were plenty of recipes that called for frozen crawfish but I
      couldn't find one single one that used live crawfish. Challenge accepted!

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>Crawfish:</h3>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons concentrated liquid shrimp and crab boil (such as
        Zatarain's®)
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
      <li>2 pounds live crawfish, rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>Potatoes, Corn, and Sausage:</h3>
      <li>1 pound bite-sized red potatoes (such as Ruby Sensations®)</li>
      <li>3 ears corn, shucked and cut into thirds, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package andouille sausage, sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine water, dry crab boil, and seafood seasoning in a
        multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add live
        crawfish. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to
        manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 0 (zero) minutes. Allow 15
        minutes for pressure to build (as the pressure builds it will steam the
        crawfish.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour crawfish
        and the liquid into a large bowl and let sit for 30 minutes to soak
        while you prepare the rest of the meal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add potatoes, corn, andouille sausage, and 1 tablespoon seafood
        seasoning to the pot. Pour in water and stir until evenly combined.
        Close and lock the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer
        for 5 minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Divide the mixture between
        4 plates and serve with crawfish.
      </li>
    </ol>
